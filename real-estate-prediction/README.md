## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a **6-week internship with InternPro** under the **AI/ML domain**.  
This project predicts **real estate prices (NT$/ping)** based on features such as transaction year, house age, distance to MRT stations, number of nearby convenience stores, and coordinates.  
It includes **data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and a user-friendly web app** built with Streamlit.

The goal is to help buyers, sellers, and analysts make informed property decisions using machine learning.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Multiple ML models with performance comparison
- Best model selection using RMSE and RÂ²
- Streamlit app for real-time prediction
- Feature importance visualization

## Dataset
- **Source file:** `data/cleaned_data_with_transaction_year.csv`
- **Target variable:** `price_per_unit_area`
- **Features used:**
  - `transaction_year`
  - `house_age`
  - `distance_to_mrt`
  - `num_convenience_stores`
  - `latitude`
  - `longitude`

## Model Performance

| Model               | RMSE  | RÂ²     |
|---------------------|-------|--------|
| Tuned Random Forest | 5.58  | 0.81   |
| Random Forest       | 5.69  | 0.81   |
| XGBoost             | 6.23  | 0.77   |
| Linear Regression   | 7.35  | 0.68   |
| Decision Tree       | 7.73  | 0.64   |

The **Tuned Random Forest** was selected as the final model and saved as `models/final_model.pkl`.
